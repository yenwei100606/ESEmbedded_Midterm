# GNU MCU Eclipse QEMU

This is the **GNU MCU Eclipse** (formerly GNU ARM Eclipse) version of **QEMU** 
for ARM Cortex-M devices.

For details, see [The GNU MCU Eclipse QEMU](https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/qemu/) page.

## Compliance

GNU MCU Eclipse QEMU currently is based on the official [QEMU](www.qemu.org), 
with major changes.

The current version is based on: 

- QEMU version 2.8.0, commit [0737f32](https://github.com/gnu-mcu-eclipse/qemu/commit/0737f32daf35f3730ed2461ddfaaf034c2ec7ff0) from Dec 20th, 2016

## Changes

Compared to the master `qemu-system-arm`, the changes are major, all 
application class ARM 
devices were removed and replaced by several Cortex-M devices.

The supported boards are:

```console
